# Archetypal Analysis Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform Archetypal Analysis (AA) using the Archetypes package. AA identifies a small number of archetypes, which are extreme examples of a dataset.

## Step 1: Import Libraries and Load Data

### In [33]

First, import the necessary libraries and load the Iris dataset.
