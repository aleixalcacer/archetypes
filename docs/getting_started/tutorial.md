# Tutorials

In this section, we provide a comprehensive set of tutorials that guide you through the fascinating world of Archetypal Analysis (AA) using the Archetypes package. These hands-on tutorials are carefully designed to take you from basic concepts to advanced applications, helping you understand the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and real-world benefits of archetypal analysis.

Whether you're a data scientist exploring new dimensionality reduction techniques, a researcher looking for interpretable clustering alternatives, or an analyst seeking to understand the extreme boundaries of your data, these tutorials will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively apply archetypal analysis to your own datasets.

The tutorials include:

- [Getting Started with Archetypal Analysis](examples/aa.ipynb): A comprehensive introduction to archetypal analysis using the classic Iris dataset. Learn the core concepts, understand the difference between archetypes and clusters, master the interpretation of mixture coefficients and archetypal compositions, and explore powerful visualization techniques including PCA projections, simplex plots, and stacked bar charts. Perfect for beginners who want to understand what makes archetypal analysis unique and powerful.

- [Mastering Archetypal Analysis Visualization](examples/visualization.ipynb): Master the art of visualizing archetypal analysis results with two powerful techniques: simplex plots for geometric representation of data points in archetypal space, and stacked bar charts for precise compositional analysis. Learn to customize color schemes, interpret mixture coefficients visually, identify archetypal purity patterns, and create compelling visualizations that reveal the hidden archetypal structure in your data.
